I am a computational neuroscientist interested in the interface between neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and psychiatry. I use machine learning to model cognitive processes especially visual inference and investigate how perturbations in these models can emulate psychiatric conditions. I utilize fMRI data as well as electronic medical records.

I am currently investigating neurological substrates of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and how they can affect physical health. My other research interests span computational neuroscience, healthcare informatics, and deep learning.

Originally from Alexandria, Egypt, I left as an electrical engineer in 2012 and have been traversing through different countries in search for good science and good human beings. I did my graduate studies in <a href='https://www.oist.jp/'>OIST</a> (MSc.) and <a href='https://kamitani-lab.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/'>Kyoto University</a> (PhD under the supervision of Prof. Yuki Kamitani). Before moving into Canada, I completed a Postdoc in <a href='https://www.wustl.edu/'>Washington University in St. Louis</a>.

When I'm not sciencing, I am either reading, playing sports (currently interested in calisthenics and bouldering but these can change anytime), <a href='travel'>travelling</a> (visas permitting), walking and listening to music, or searching for a new fun activity.

I also appreciate a good conversation about politics, human rights, history, philosophy, and geography. In a parallel universe (or alternate timeline), I'm a news reporter covering hot events live from the field. I'm a pan-Arab, pan-African, and pan-World (if that's a thing). When it comes to food, I'm very politically incorrect and biased so ask me at your own risk.
