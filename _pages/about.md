Originally from Alexandria, Egypt, I left as an electrical engineer in 2012 and have been traversing through different countries in search for good science and good human beings. I did my graduate studies in <a href='https://www.oist.jp/'>OIST</a> (MSc.) and <a href='https://kamitani-lab.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/'>Kyoto University</a> (PhD under the supervision of Prof. Yuki Kamitani). Before moving into Canada, I completed a Postdoc in <a href='https://www.wustl.edu/'>Washington University in St. Louis</a>.

I am currently investigating neurological substrates of mental illness that lead to other complications. My other research interests span computational neuroscience, healthcare informatics, and deep learning.

When I'm not sciencing, I am either reading, playing sports (currently interested in calisthenics and bouldering but these can change anytime), <a href='fun'>travelling</a> (visas permitting), walking and listening to music, or searching for a new fun activity.

I also appreciate a good conversation about politics, human rights, history, philosophy, and geography. In a parallel universe (or alternate timeline), I'm a news reporter covering hot events live from the field. I'm a pan-Arab, pan-African, and pan-World (if that's a thing). When it comes to food, I'm very politically incorrect and biased so ask me at your own risk.
